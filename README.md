# Scala_Course
## Overview
Functional-based programming in Scala from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

### Purpose
This course was split into 5 topics

1) *Functional Programming Principles in Scala* -
Introduces functional-based programming with immutable objects, using recursive techniques and higher-order functions.

2) *Functional Program Design in Scala* -
Reviews mathematical concepts like Monoids and Tree Structures through the Type-Directed and Functional Reactive Programming Paradigms- uncovering the advantages of an FRP approach.

3) *Parallel Programming* -
Split and balance workloads to optimize algorithms on specific hardware.

4) *Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark* -
Optimize large collections with Sparks RDDs, construct DataFrame for relational manipulation, and query big data efficiently.

5) *Functional Programming in Scala Capstone* -
Build a data-intensive weather dashboard allowing users to analyze climate change.

### About the Program
A self-paced course, requiring students to submit 4-5 assignments for each topic. Modules are submitted through sbt submissions and are graded based on how well different algorithms are optimized.
